# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation
This repository implements a deep learning-based system that recognizes different types of food and estimates their calorie content with an accuracy rate of up to 97%. The project leverages image recognition techniques and pre-trained models to classify food items and compute approximate calorie content based on standard nutritional databases.

# Table of Contents
Overview Features Installation Dataset Usage Food Recognition Calorie Estimation Real-time Detection Model Performance Contributing License Overview This project is designed to recognize various food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The system achieves a high level of accuracy (~97%) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained on a large, curated food dataset.

The calorie estimation is derived from the recognized food item and corresponding nutritional information, providing a rough estimate of the total calorie content based on portion size.

# Features
Food Classification: Recognizes a wide range of food categories from images. Calorie Estimation: Provides an estimated calorie count for recognized food items. High Accuracy: Achieves 97% accuracy using a deep neural network trained on a large food dataset. Real-time Recognition: Uses OpenCV to perform real-time food recognition from a video feed or camera. Pre-trained Model: Uses transfer learning from pre-trained models such as ResNet or InceptionV3 for better performance.

# Installation
Prerequisites Python 3.x TensorFlow or PyTorch OpenCV for image processing Numpy, Pandas for data handling Flask (for web integration, optional) Scikit-learn for model evaluation Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization Install Dependencies

# Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt Clone the Repository

# Copy code
git clone https://github.com/samarthgarde007/ML-5-Python-food-101/edit/main/README.md Dataset The dataset contains labeled images of various food items along with their nutritional information. It includes common foods like fruits, vegetables, fast food, and beverages.

You can download the dataset from Dataset Link. Ensure the dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets. Each image is associated with a food class label and the corresponding nutritional data (calories per serving). Usage Food Recognition To run the food recognition on a set of images, use the predict.py script. Make sure to provide the path to the images and the model.

Copy code python predict.py --images path_to_images --model path_to_model

# Calorie Estimation
After recognizing the food, the system estimates the calorie content based on standard portion sizes. You can also provide custom portion sizes for more accurate estimates.

bash Copy code python estimate_calories.py --image path_to_image --model path_to_model --portion_size 100 This will output the recognized food item and an estimated calorie content.

Real-time Detection For real-time food recognition and calorie estimation from a webcam or video feed:

# Copy code
python realtime_recognition.py --model path_to_model This will open a live feed where the system will recognize food items in real-time and display the estimated calories.

# Model Performance
The food recognition model has been trained using a dataset of over 50,000 labeled food images and achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test set. The calorie estimation is derived using a combination of image classification and nutritional databases.

You can evaluate the model performance by running:

Copy code python evaluate_model.py --model path_to_model --test_data path_to_test_data This will output the precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy.
